### Introduction
Our project provides insights to people on the global rise of COVID-19 cases along with information on where people are meeting or planning to meetup. With our project we want to help people understand that COVID-19 should be taken seriously. People should be aware of the locations where the cases are high and for the same location they can see if people are meeting or not.
Our web application provides following visualizations â€“
*	Data extracted from Twitter filtered over keywords like meetup, meet
*	Real-time COVID-19 new cases, new deaths
*	Predicted Deaths
